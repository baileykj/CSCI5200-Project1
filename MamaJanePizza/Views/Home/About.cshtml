    <h1>Our Story</h1>

    <h3>WHO WE ARE.</h3>
    There’s nothing cookie-cutter about Mama Jane Pizza. Not our pizzas. Not our people. And definitely not the way we live life. Around here, we don’t settle for anything less than food we’re proud to serve. And we don’t just clock in. Not when we can also become our best, make friends, and have fun while we’re at it. We’re the pizza company that lives life unboxed.

    Whether it’s the original Stuffed Crust or putting a pizza in outer space, we never stop driving ourselves to deliver hot pizzas, fast every time – anywhere you want to enjoy it.

    <h3>WHAT WE’RE ABOUT.</h3>
    At Mama Jane Pizza, we don’t just make pizza. We make people happy. Mama Jane Pizza was built on the belief that pizza night should be special, and we carry that belief into everything we do. With more than 60 years of experience under our belts, we understand how to best serve our customers through tried and true service principles: We create food we’re proud to serve and deliver it fast, with a smile.

   <h3>WHERE WE COME FROM.</h3>
    In 1958, Jane borrowed $600 from her mom to open a pizza place in Johnson City, Tennessee. She named it Mama Jane Pizza, because her sign only had room for thirteen letters. How profound!

    Soon, the restaurant grew. Why? The pizza was awesome. The service felt like home. And the customers were treated like family.

    And we’ve been delivering that same food and service ever since.

    <h3>FOR THE LOVE OF PIZZA SINCE 1958.</h3>
    From day one, Jane could look her customers in the eye and promise them the finest pizza in town — because she knew the farmers who grew the ingredients, and she knew those farmers cared about quality.

    Since then, our farmers have grown right alongside us, and the ingredients we use are still our highest priority. No one loves pizza more than Mama Jane Pizza. That’s why pizza is in our name — and always will be.
